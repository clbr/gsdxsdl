GSdx SDL/GL fork
================

It was rather annoying to find out PCSX2's only working graphics plugin
required GL 3.3 even in software mode. Incidentally, I do not have GL 3.3.

So, I resurrected the several years old SDL2 device, moved it to SDL1,
and then to GL 1.3 for an accelerated scale+blit and vsync.

This works in the software mode on pcsx2 1.4. Use at your own risk,
I'm posting this mostly as an off-site backup, and I'm not interested
in bug reports or patches.
